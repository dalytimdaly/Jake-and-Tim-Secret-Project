This Is Where Our Notes Will Go?

PITCH
1. We got came up for this application because we both think space is cool and this seems feasible.

2. Our core MVP features will be: 
- submitting comments on images
- "favoriting" the images and storing that information
- searching or filtering through each image by categories "date, sol, camera" 

3. Our API data will be from NASA's API website database. It includes a large list of images, captions and information fro Mars' rovers. We will use this API to access that information and render our web aplication. 

4. I think our upcoming challenges will be accessing the data in a way that works well with how we want to create our filter parameters.
